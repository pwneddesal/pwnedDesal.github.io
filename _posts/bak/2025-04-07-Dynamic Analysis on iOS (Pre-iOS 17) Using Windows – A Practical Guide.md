# **Dynamic Analysis on iOS (Pre-iOS 17) Using Windows ‚Äì A Practical Guide**  

Penetration testing iOS applications without macOS can be tricky, especially if your device is **running iOS 16 or lower**. Apple imposes strict security measures, restricting system access and sandboxing applications, but **dynamic analysis is still possible on Windows** using sideloading techniques and runtime manipulation tools.  

This guide focuses on **Windows-based dynamic analysis** for iOS apps using **Frida, Objection, and AltStore**, offering hands-on techniques for testing security vulnerabilities **without macOS or jailbreaking your device**.  

---

## **üîπ Why Perform Dynamic Analysis on iOS?**  
Static analysis (reverse engineering an app‚Äôs code) is useful, but **dynamic analysis** allows testers to interact with applications in real-time, intercept API calls, modify function outputs, and **test authentication mechanisms while the app is running**.  

If your iPhone **runs iOS 16 or lower**, you can **bypass restrictions and conduct real-time security testing** using tools that don't require a jailbroken device.  

---

## **üõ† Essential Tools for Windows-Based Dynamic Analysis**  
Windows users can set up an effective **iOS security testing environment** without macOS using the following tools:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ AltStore ‚Äì Sideload Apps Without Jailbreak**  
Since Apple prevents direct app installations outside the App Store, **AltStore** provides a reliable sideloading method.  

‚úî Install apps for penetration testing (like DVIA-v2)  
‚úî Doesn't require a developer account  
‚úî Works for non-jailbroken iOS devices

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Frida ‚Äì Dynamic Hooking & Runtime Manipulation**  
Frida is a powerful framework for interacting with running iOS apps. It allows testers to **trace API calls, modify function behavior, and extract sensitive data**.  

‚úî Hook into running iOS processes  
‚úî Modify authentication methods dynamically  
‚úî Bypass security measures like Touch ID  

#### **Installing Frida on Windows**  
Run the following command in **Windows PowerShell**:  
```shell
pip install frida-tools
```
Verify installation:  
```shell
frida --version
```
To connect Frida to your **iOS device** via USB:  
```shell
frida -U -n Safari -i
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Objection ‚Äì Automating Runtime Manipulation**  
Objection simplifies Frida usage by providing automated runtime manipulation commands.  

‚úî Identify insecure storage methods  
‚úî Modify authentication and return values dynamically  
‚úî Extract hidden data  

#### **Installing Objection on Windows**  
```shell
pip install objection
```
Example command to modify login validation dynamically:  
```shell
objection --gadget DVIA-v2 explore
ios hooking set return_value "[LoginValidate isLoginValidated]" true
```

## **üì° Connecting iOS to Windows for Dynamic Testing**  
To interact with running iOS applications from Windows, follow these steps:  

### **Step 1: Pair Your iOS Device**
Pairing your iPhone with Windows allows Frida and Objection to interact with apps.  
```shell
idevicepair pair
ideviceimagemounter -t Developer DeveloperDiskImage.dmg DeveloperDiskImage.dmg.signature
```
or verify connection:  
```shell
ideviceimagemounter -l
```

---

### **Step 2: Listing Running iOS Processes**
To trace an application using **Frida**, first list all running processes on your iPhone:  
```shell
frida-ps -Ua
```
This enables testers to **attach Frida to a specific app** for dynamic analysis.  

---

### **Step 3: Hooking iOS Functions for Analysis**  
Use Frida to monitor login functions in **DVIA-v2** (a vulnerable iOS app for security testing).  
```shell
frida-trace -U -n DVIA-v2 -i "*login*"
```
This command hooks into **login-related functions**, allowing testers to **modify authentication checks dynamically**.  

---

## **üîê Dumping Keychain Data on iOS (Without macOS or Jailbreak)**  
Many iOS apps store passwords and tokens inside **Keychain**, making it a prime target for security testing.  

#### **Extracting Keychain Data with Frida**
```shell
frida -U -n KeychainDump -e 'Keychain.dump()'
```
Check out this detailed **OWASP guide** for Keychain security analysis:

## **üöÄ Wrapping Up: Dynamic Analysis on iOS Without macOS**  
Even if your iOS device **runs version 16 or lower**, and you **only have Windows**, **you can still perform in-depth security testing** using **AltStore, Frida, and Objection**. These tools allow real-time analysis, function hooking, and authentication bypass techniques without needing a MacBook or jailbreaking your iPhone.
